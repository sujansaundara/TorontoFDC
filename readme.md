# toronto food_drink_and_chill spots

*Some of these places will have long lines and waits. Most places can be pre-booked. Opentable.ca for booking ahead.* 

*Toronto has a great Craft beer scene. There are a lot of Micro-Brewery+Restaurant Combination places. If your friends are into craft beer, I can give some more focused recommendations.*
